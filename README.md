# Violent_Videos_Classification

Extracting frames from violent and non-violent videos using OpenCV library. 
Building two models one using CNN-RNN architecture and the other one using pretrained Mobilnet model and LSTM and the integration of YOLOv8 and YOLO-NAS for detection. 
Training the model and getting up to 94% accuracy using Mobilnet-LSTM architecture. Deploying the model using Flask and containerizing it using Docker.

Technologies: TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, LSTM, Mobilnet, YOLO, Fine-tuning, OpenCV, Flask, Docker.
